# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Null and Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to handling null and falsy values within a function.  The `foo` function adds two numbers, but its treatment of `null` might inadvertently affect other falsy values.

## Bug Description

The function `foo` correctly handles `null` values by returning 0.  However, it doesn't explicitly check for other falsy values that might lead to unexpected results. For example, passing 0 or an empty string could lead to incorrect output.

## Solution

The solution addresses this by explicitly checking for both `null` and `undefined` and handles other falsy values appropriately.
